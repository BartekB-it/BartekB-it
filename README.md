Hands-on blue-team work: vulnerability management, Windows hardening, SOC-style investigations (Sentinel + Defender), OSINT/CTI volunteering and a lightweight SIEM/log parser.

## 📅 Current Focus (Dec 2025)

- 🔭 **LogSniper** – refactor & documentation of the detection engine (rules explained, tuned and tested).
- 🧪 **SOC L1 prep** – blue-team labs, KQL practice and interview preparation.

## 🧪 Public-Sector Security Prototypes (Hackathon)

Built during a 24-hour national hackathon focused on fighting online disinformation and phishing targeting Polish citizens.

- [**Prawda w sieci - Verifier (gov.pl URL & QR checker)**](https://github.com/BartekB-it/prawda-w-sieci-verifier)
  Security-focused backend + frontend prototype for an mObywatel-style module that checks whether a link or QR code claiming to be `gov.pl` site is actually trustworthy.
  The Verifier:
  - validates the domain against an allow-list of trusted gov.pl resources,
  - enforces HTTPS/TLS and inspects certificates,
  - follows redirects to detect suspicious destinations,
  - returns a clear "trusted / suspicious" verdict that could be shown in a mobile app.
 
- [**Prawda w sieci - Trusted gov.pl QR generator widget**](https://github.com/BartekB-it/qr-generator)
  Small frontend widget styled after gov.pl / mObywatel that generates QR codes only for trusted `gov.pl` URLs.
  It is designed to work together with the Verifier:
  office generates a QR code -> citizen scans it in the app -> the Verifier checks the URL and shows wheter the page is legitimate.

*These were rapid prototypes built with heavy AI assistance - our focus was on the security design, threat model and user flow.*
