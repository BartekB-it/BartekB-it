Hands-on blue-team work: vulnerability management, Windows hardening, SOC-style investigations (Sentinel + Defender), OSINT/CTI volunteering and a lightweight SIEM/log parser.

## 📅 Current Focus (Dec 2025)

- 🔭 **LogSniper** - refactor & documentation of the detection engine (rules explained, tuned and tested).
- 🧪 **SOC L1 prep** - blue-team labs, KQL practice and interview preparation.

## 🧪 Public-Sector Security Prototypes (Hackathon)

Built during a 24-hour national hackathon focused on fighting online disinformation and phishing targeting Polish citizens.

- [**Prawda w sieci - Verifier (gov.pl URL & QR checker)**](https://github.com/BartekB-it/prawda-w-sieci-verifier)
  Web app + backend prototype that lets a user paste a link or scan a QR code claiming to be a `gov.pl` page and get a clear “trusted / expired / invalid”-style verdict.  
  Focus on:
  - server-side session / token checks instead of trusting the raw QR,
  - simple validation and basic input hardening to reduce obvious abuse.
 
- [**Prawda w sieci - Trusted gov.pl QR generator widget**](https://github.com/BartekB-it/qr-generator)
  Small widget (gov.pl / mObywatel style) for offices to generate time-limited QR codes only for approved `gov.pl` URLs.  
  Designed to work together with the Verifier:  
  office generates QR → citizen scans in the app → Verifier checks the backend entry and shows whether the page is legitimate.

*These were rapid prototypes built with heavy AI assistance - our focus was on the security design, threat model and user flow.*
